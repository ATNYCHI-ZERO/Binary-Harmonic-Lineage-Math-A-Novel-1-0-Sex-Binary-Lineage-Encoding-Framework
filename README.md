# Binary-Harmonic-Lineage-Math-A-Novel-1-0-Sex-Binary-Lineage-Encoding-Framework
Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math is introduced as a rigorous framework for encoding lineage (ancestry or provenance) using binary symbols and interpreting these encodings in a harmonic (signal-based) context. We formalize a 1/0 sex-binary lineage encoding system in which each bit represents a paternal or maternal link in a lineage. This scheme naturally maps genealogical ancestry onto binary strings, enabling unique identifiers for each ancestor and new algebraic operations on lineage data. We prove fundamental properties of this encoding – including uniqueness of representation, generational distance correspondence, and rules for combining lineages – and we develop a harmonic interpretation whereby each binary lineage code is associated with a unique combination of basis frequencies. This binary-harmonic representation allows lineage information to be analyzed with signal-processing techniques, offering novel insights into patterns of inheritance and data provenance. We discuss applications across biological genealogy, digital identity provenance, and critical infrastructure security. In particular, we demonstrate how the framework can be integrated into defense or XAI systems for infrastructure hardening, ensuring traceable and explainable lineage of decisions and data. An implementation in Python is provided (with detailed documentation) to illustrate how a seamless switchover to the binary-harmonic model can be achieved for secure systems. The paper is structured with formal definitions, theoretical results with proofs, examples, and an application-focused discussion, culminating in an extensible foundation for future research and deployment in lineage tracking and analysis.

Introduction

Tracking lineage – whether in biological genealogies, digital data provenance, or systems inheritance – is crucial for understanding how entities evolve and how information flows over time. Traditional genealogical notation (e.g. family trees) and data provenance records often lack a compact mathematical formalism that enables algebraic manipulation or analysis of lineage patterns. To address this gap, we propose Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math, a novel framework that encodes lineage relationships in binary form and leverages harmonic (frequency-based) interpretations of these codes. The term “1/0 sex-binary lineage encoding” refers to our scheme of representing lineage links (parental contributions) using binary digits 1 and 0, corresponding to the two biological sexes or two abstract parent categories in a lineage. In a human genealogy context, this means representing paternal links with one binary value and maternal links with the other, reflecting the sex of each parent in the ancestral chain. More generally, any lineage or provenance that involves two distinct types of parentage or source can be encoded in this binary manner.

The goal of this framework is multifold: (1) to provide a formal encoding that uniquely identifies any ancestor or source in a lineage through a binary string; (2) to introduce a harmonic signal interpretation of these binary codes, treating the binary sequence as a combination of basis signals, which opens up analysis via Fourier techniques or signal processing; and (3) to demonstrate how this model can be implemented and integrated into real systems (e.g. for cybersecurity and explainable AI) in a seamless way, improving traceability and resilience of infrastructure by encoding the “genealogy” of decisions or data packets.

This work builds upon ideas from classic genealogical numbering systems. In particular, the Ahnentafel numbering system (Eytzinger’s method from 1590) assigns a number to each ancestor of a person such that the father is 2n and the mother is 2n+1
en.wikipedia.org
. This implies a binary structure: in binary notation, an ancestor’s number encodes the path of father/mother steps to reach that ancestor

. For example, in Ahnentafel, the subject is 1; their father is 2 (binary 10), mother is 3 (binary 11); paternal grandfather is 4 (100), etc. Ignoring the leading 1 in these binary representations yields 0, 1, 00, etc., which directly correspond to sequences of father (0) and mother (1) steps
thatsmaths.com
. Indeed, an Ahnentafel list is essentially a binary tree of ancestors written in linear form
thatsmaths.com
. We generalize this idea into a comprehensive mathematical system. We define a binary lineage encoding for an arbitrary lineage tree (biological or abstract), develop operations and metrics on these encodings, and then extend the concept by defining a harmonic mapping: viewing the binary code as a sequence that can be interpreted as a waveform or frequency signature.

Why “harmonic”? In our framework, each generational step in the lineage is associated with a doubling of a base frequency, analogous to musical or signal harmonics, and the choice of parent (one of two types) determines the phase or sign of that frequency component. This harmonic interpretation allows us to regard a lineage code not just as an identifier, but as a signal or spectrum – a perspective that can reveal patterns (e.g., alternating parentage corresponds to periodic signals) and offers a new toolkit (filtering, correlation, etc.) for lineage analysis. The binary-harmonic lineage model thereby bridges discrete family-tree logic with continuous signal analysis.

The contributions of this paper include: (a) a formal definition of the binary lineage encoding scheme with proofs of its core properties (bijectivity, prefix relationships corresponding to common ancestors, etc.), (b) the introduction of a harmonic signal representation of lineage codes with a theorem proving the uniqueness of this representation, (c) discussion of how lineage encoding can be applied beyond human genealogy – including tracking digital identity lineage, data provenance in AI systems, and inheritance in software – to improve explainability and security, and (d) an implementation in code that demonstrates how existing systems can transition to using this model without disruption. The seamless switchover aspect is addressed by showing that our encoding layer can overlay on current data structures (for example, wrapping data or events with lineage metadata) without requiring changes in core logic, thereby hardening infrastructure by adding traceability transparently.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Background, we review traditional lineage representation methods and introduce the intuition behind binary encoding and harmonic interpretation. In Formalism, we provide rigorous definitions of the Binary-Harmonic Lineage system, including the encoding function and harmonic mapping, and we state key properties and theorems. The Proofs section contains formal proofs of uniqueness and other properties of the encoding and its harmonic representation. In Discussion, we explore the implications of the framework, compare it to related concepts (like data provenance graphs and genealogical number systems), and address potential limitations (such as handling of non-binary or merged lineages). The Applications section demonstrates use cases: we explain how the model can track lineage in a cybersecurity context (e.g., tracing the origin of commands in a control system), and how it can be used in XAI (e.g., encoding the lineage of an AI decision through layers of influence). Finally, the Conclusion summarizes findings and suggests future research directions (such as extending to non-binary lineage or real-time signal monitoring of lineage changes). An Appendix provides a Python implementation of the framework, with code and commentary illustrating integration into an existing system for infrastructure hardening.

Background

Lineage Representation in Genealogy and Data Provenance: Lineage, broadly speaking, is the sequence of predecessors or source elements leading to a given entity. In human genealogy, lineage is depicted by family trees. Each person has two biological parents (in sexually reproducing species), yielding a binary tree of ancestors when traced backwards in time. Numbering systems like the Ahnentafel exploit this binary tree structure by assigning numbers such that one can compute relationships from the numbers alone
en.wikipedia.org
thatsmaths.com
. For instance, as noted, an individual’s father is assigned 2× the individual’s number, and the mother 2× plus 1
en.wikipedia.org
. All even-numbered ancestors in this scheme are male and odd-numbered are female
thatsmaths.com
, reflecting the binary sex distinction in parentage. By converting these numbers to binary, we obtain a direct encoding of lineage: except for the leading bit, each binary digit can be read as an instruction – e.g., “0” = go to father, “1” = go to mother – when traversing from the descendant to an ancestor
thatsmaths.com
. As an example, the binary sequence 1101 (which is 13 in decimal) can be interpreted as: subject’s mother’s father’s mother
thatsmaths.com
. Breaking it down: the first 1 indicates the subject’s mother, the next 1 indicates that mother’s mother (hence subject’s maternal grandmother), then 0 indicates that grandmother’s father (maternal great-grandfather), and the last 1 indicates his mother (maternal great-great-grandmother). This one-to-one mapping between binary strings and ancestor descriptions illustrates the potential of binary encoding for lineage.

Figure 1: Binary representation of a simple ancestry tree (up to grandparents). The subject (root) is at the top, with no code (empty string). A “0” at a branch indicates a paternal (male) link and “1” indicates a maternal (female) link. Thus, the father is encoded as 0 and the mother as 1. At the next generation, the paternal grandfather is 00 (father’s father), paternal grandmother 01 (father’s mother), maternal grandfather 10 (mother’s father), and maternal grandmother 11 (mother’s mother). Each additional bit extends one generation back. This encoding is equivalent to the binary Ahnentafel numbering
en.wikipedia.org
, but using 0/1 instead of M/F.

Genealogical binary encoding, as exemplified above, serves as a foundation for our framework. However, traditional approaches stop at using the codes as static identifiers. Our framework extends this by introducing operations on these codes (treating them as elements of a mathematical space) and by applying a harmonic interpretation, which views the binary sequence as a sequence of signals or frequencies. Before introducing the formal system, it is useful to consider analogies in other domains:

In data science and databases, data lineage (or data provenance) tracks the origins and transformations of a data item. Often this is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) rather than a tree, since a data item can be produced by combining multiple sources. In cases where data is combined pairwise (binary operations), the provenance graph is a binary tree. Even when not strictly binary, one can often decompose multi-source operations into binary steps. Encoding data lineage in a compact form is valuable for auditing and explainability: if each datum carries a “provenance code,” it becomes easier to trace back through logs or processing steps to identify sources. Our binary lineage encoding can serve this role, treating each combination as analogous to a “parent” event. Indeed, in the context of Explainable AI (XAI), researchers emphasize that having a clear provenance (lineage) of decisions or inputs is key to trustworthy explanations
bix-tech.com
. By mapping decision paths to binary sequences (e.g., in a binary decision tree classifier, the path taken can be encoded in 0/1 for each binary split), one obtains a human-readable and machine-analysable code for the model’s reasoning.

In critical infrastructure systems, understanding the lineage of commands or configurations is crucial for security. For example, consider a control command in a power grid: it might originate from an operator (human) or an automated system, and it might pass through various checks or subsystems (each of which could either approve/pass it or modify it). We can think of the command’s journey as a lineage: at each step, the command’s “parent” could be a human decision (type 0) or an automated rule (type 1), for instance. If we encode this as a binary sequence, any command can carry a stamp of its lineage. A command with an unexpected lineage code (e.g., indicating an impossible sequence of approvals) could flag a security breach (like an injected or spoofed command). Furthermore, if a system needs to switch over to a backup or alternate control path, having a unified lineage encoding means the switchover can occur seamlessly: both primary and backup systems use the same coding to track the origin of events, ensuring continuity in monitoring and audit logs. Our framework’s implementation (see Appendix) demonstrates how wrapping events with lineage metadata can be layered onto existing infrastructure with minimal disruption, thus hardening the system.

In software engineering, particularly object-oriented design, one speaks of class inheritance lineage. Although not binary (a class can inherit from multiple interfaces in some languages, etc.), many inheritance structures are trees. A similar binary encoding could, in theory, label each subclass as coming from a particular parent class or interface (e.g., distinguishing whether a method was inherited from one base or another). In version control systems (like Git), each commit has parent commits; most commits have a single parent (linear development), but merge commits have two parents (branch merge) – a structure analogous to biological reproduction. A commit’s lineage could thus be encoded in binary by treating one parent as “0” and the other as “1”. This might be used to quickly encode and compare branches or to visualize the history in a compact form. While we do not explore this in depth, it highlights the versatility of binary lineage encoding beyond biology.

Given these contexts, Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math aims to unify the treatment of lineage information. In the next section, we formally define the encoding scheme and the mathematical structures around it.

Formalism

In this section, we define the core components of the Binary-Harmonic Lineage framework. The formalism is presented in two parts: (a) Binary Lineage Encoding, which covers the discrete, combinatorial structure (binary strings representing lineage nodes, and algebraic operations on them), and (b) Harmonic Representation, which provides an analytic view of these binary codes as signals or frequency-domain objects. We then enumerate important properties of the system, setting the stage for formal proofs.

Binary Lineage Encoding Scheme

Lineage Tree and Encoding: We assume a root entity (for example, a person in a genealogy, a final data item, or a final decision in a process) and consider its lineage (ancestors or source contributors). We suppose that at each lineage step, there are two possible parent contributors, which we label as type-0 and type-1. In a human genealogy these correspond to father (type-0) and mother (type-1) – hence the term “sex-binary” encoding. In a more abstract lineage, “0” and “1” could be two distinct categories of source or influence (e.g., manual vs automatic source, left input vs right input in data merge, etc.). We formalize the lineage as a rooted full binary tree:

The root node represents the entity of interest (the descendant whose lineage we are encoding).

Each node in the tree has either zero or two children. If a node represents an entity, its two children represent that entity’s two parents (or two source components). We label the edge to one child as 0 (indicating the type-0 parent) and the edge to the other child as 1 (indicating the type-1 parent). We will often refer to “the 0-parent” and “the 1-parent” of a node to denote the parent reached by a 0-edge or 1-edge respectively.

For a given node in the lineage tree, we define its lineage code as the sequence of labels on the edges from the root down to that node. Equivalently, if we traverse upwards from a node to the root, reading 0 or 1 for each parent choice, we obtain the code in reverse order. By convention, we will define the code from the root’s perspective (root to node). Thus:

The root (the subject whose lineage we encode) is assigned an empty string as its code (since no edges are needed to reach itself). We may denote this empty string by $\epsilon$. In some contexts, a special symbol like “1” is used for the root in Ahnentafel binary coding
thatsmaths.com
, but here we find it convenient to use $\epsilon$ to signify the absence of any parent step.

If an ancestor is reached by first going to the subject’s 0-parent (father), then 1-parent (mother), then 1-parent again, the code for that ancestor would be 0-1-1 or simply the concatenated binary string 011. In general, a code is a finite binary string such as 10110... where the first bit corresponds to the first generation parent (0 = father, 1 = mother, in the genealogical interpretation), the second bit corresponds to the second generation, and so on.

Formally, let ${0,1}^$ denote the set of all finite binary strings (including the empty string $\epsilon$). For a given lineage tree (with no inbreeding or merging assumed for now, so it is a proper binary tree), we define an encoding function $E: { \text{nodes in lineage tree}} \to {0,1}^$ such that: $E(\text{root}) = \epsilon$, and for any node $X$, if $Y$ is the 0-parent of $X$, then $E(Y) = E(X) ,||, 0$ (where $||$ denotes string concatenation), and if $Z$ is the 1-parent of $X$, then $E(Z) = E(X) ,||, 1$. In simpler terms, appending a 0 to a node’s code gives the code of its father, and appending a 1 gives the code of its mother
en.wikipedia.org
. Conversely, given a code, removing the last bit yields the code of that person’s child (i.e., moving one generation toward the root).

Under this encoding, every distinct ancestor node receives a distinct binary code. In an ideal infinite binary tree without merging, the mapping from nodes to codes is bijective. If the real lineage has pedigree collapse (the same ancestor appearing via two different paths, such as a distant cousin marriage), then the same real individual would have two different codes in the conceptual tree (one for each distinct position in the tree). In such cases, the encoding still produces distinct codes for the two positions in the lineage graph; if needed, one can subsequently identify that those codes refer to the same individual by auxiliary data, but the code itself encodes a position, not a unique person identifier in presence of loops. For simplicity, our formal proofs assume no merging (so the lineage graph is a tree), but we will discuss the implications of merges later.

Several useful properties are immediate from this construction:

Generation and Code Length: The length of the binary string $E(Node)$ is exactly the generation number of that node relative to the root. (Here we define the root’s generation as 0, its parents as generation 1, grandparents generation 2, etc.) For example, a code of length 3 like 011 denotes a 3rd-generation ancestor (great-grandparent in human terms). In fact, in an Ahnentafel numbering, the generation number is $\lfloor \log_2(\text{Number})\rfloor + 1$, which equals the number of binary digits of the number
thatsmaths.com
. In our encoding, the number of binary digits (bits) is the generation count, since the root is length 0. We denote by $|c|$ the length of a code $c$. If $|c| = n$, we say the node is at generation $n$.

Sex of Ancestor: From the code, one can immediately determine the sex of the ancestor it represents (in a sexed reproduction scenario). If $c$ is non-empty, look at the last bit of $c$: if it is 0, then that ancestor is male (since the last step to reach them was via a father); if it is 1, the ancestor is female (the last step was via a mother). This corresponds to the property that even-numbered Ahnentafel IDs (ending in 0 in binary) are men and odd-numbered (ending in 1) are women
thatsmaths.com
. For example, a code 1001 ends in 1, so it refers to a female (say, a mother’s father’s mother). The only exception is the root, which has no bits; the root’s sex could be separately noted if needed (some binary lineage schemes prepend a bit for the root’s sex
en.wikipedia.org
, but we treat it as metadata rather than part of the lineage path code).

Prefix Relations and Common Ancestry: If we have two codes, say $u$ and $v$, representing two individuals in the tree, then their longest common prefix corresponds to their most recent common ancestor (MRCA). For example, consider codes 0100 and 0111. They share the prefix 01. That prefix 01 corresponds to an ancestor – indeed, 01 as a code represents the subject’s father’s mother (paternal grandmother). And indeed, the individuals with code 0100 (which is 01 + 00, i.e. paternal grandmother’s father) and 0111 (01 + 11, paternal grandmother’s mother) share the 01 ancestor (the paternal grandmother) as the closest common node. In general, if a code $p$ is a prefix of code $q$ (we write $p \sqsubseteq q$), then the node $p$ lies on the lineage path from the root to node $q$ – i.e., $p$ is an ancestor of $q$. Two nodes are related if and only if one’s code is a prefix of the other’s code in this system. If neither code is a prefix of the other (they lie in different branches), truncate both codes to their longest common prefix $r$ (possibly $\epsilon$ if none in common); the node $r$ is their MRCA. This relationship can be formalized via the prefix partial order on ${0,1}^*$.

Combining Lineages (Mating or Merging): Consider modeling the creation of a new node (child) from two parent nodes. In the binary encoding, from the child’s perspective, the father gets code 0 and the mother gets code 1 (since they are 1 generation away, via a 0-link or 1-link respectively). Now, what about the grandparents as seen by the child? The father’s parents will then be 00 and 01 (prefix 0 for father’s side, then 0 or 1), and the mother’s parents 10 and 11 (prefix 1 for mother’s side, then 0 or 1). In effect, the child’s entire ancestry tree’s codes can be constructed by taking the father’s ancestry and prefixing every code with 0, and taking the mother’s ancestry and prefixing every code with 1. We can describe this operation generally: if $A$ is a set of codes representing one lineage (say, the father’s ancestors relative to the father) and $B$ represents another’s lineage (mother’s ancestors relative to mother), then the child’s lineage set would be ${ "0"||a : a \in A} \cup { "1"||b : b \in B} \cup {\epsilon}$ (including the child as $\epsilon$). Here, if we consider $A$ and $B$ both include the empty string for the parent themselves, the formula still holds: prefixing $\epsilon$ with 0 gives 0 = father, prefixing with 1 gives 1 = mother. This union of prefixed sets essentially merges two binary trees under a new root, which is exactly how one would construct a child’s lineage from parental lineages. In algebraic terms, we can think of an operation $\oplus$ that takes two sets of binary strings and produces a new set by prefixing one set with 0 and the other with 1. At the level of individual codes, we might define a rule for composing a child’s code with a parent’s code to get a grandparent’s code, but because our encoding is absolute (always relative to the primary root), it’s more straightforward to handle lineage combination as above. We will leverage this idea in the Application section when discussing how to merge provenance from multiple sources.

With the binary encoding scheme defined, we now introduce the second pillar of our framework: the harmonic or signal-based interpretation of these codes.

Harmonic Lineage Representation

To imbue the binary codes with a harmonic structure, we interpret a binary sequence as a specification of coefficients in a Fourier-like series. The motivation is that a binary lineage code can be seen as a sequence of choices (0/1) across generations (discrete time steps), which is analogous to a digital signal. By mapping generation number to frequency (specifically, higher generations correspond to higher frequency components – hence “harmonics” as higher integer multiples of a fundamental frequency), and mapping the bit value to a phase or amplitude sign, we can create a unique waveform for each lineage path.

Frequency Assignment: Let $f_0$ be a fundamental frequency (this can be an abstract unit frequency for mathematical analysis; the exact value is not important as long as distinct harmonics are orthogonal). We assign frequency $2^k f_0$ to generation $k+1$. In other words:

Generation 1 (parents) is associated with frequency $2^0 f_0 = f_0$ (the fundamental),

Generation 2 (grandparents) with $2^1 f_0$ (the second harmonic),

Generation 3 with $2^2 f_0$ (four times fundamental, which is the next octave if thinking musically),
and in general generation $n$ with $2^{n-1} f_0$.

Thus, there is a distinct frequency (or say sinusoidal basis function) corresponding to each bit position in the lineage code. Now, given a particular ancestor with code $b_1 b_2 ... b_n$ (where $b_1$ is the first bit, corresponding to generation 1, and $b_n$ the last bit at generation $n$), we will construct a signal composed of the first $n$ harmonics (frequencies $f_0, 2f_0, 4f_0, ..., 2^{n-1}f_0$). The bit values $b_i \in {0,1}$ will determine the phase or sign of the contribution of each frequency.

One convenient scheme is to let the bit value determine a phase of 0 or $\pi$ (in radians) for a cosine wave at that frequency, or equivalently, a sign $+1$ or $-1$ for a sine wave. For concreteness, we define the lineage signal $S(c; t)$ corresponding to a code $c = b_1 b_2 \dots b_n$ as:

),

where $\omega_0 = 2\pi f_0$ (the angular frequency of the fundamental), $A_i$ is an amplitude (we can take $A_i=1$ for simplicity, or choose a decaying amplitude to give higher generations less weight if desired), and the phase $\phi_i$ is determined by $b_i$ as $\phi_i = 0$ if $b_i = 0$ or $\phi_i = \pi$ if $b_i = 1$. In other words, each bit decides whether the cosine at that harmonic is in phase ($+1$ multiplier at $t=0$) or out of phase ($-1$ multiplier at $t=0$). Equivalently, we could express it as a sine series with $\pm 1$ coefficients:

t),

since $\sin(\cdot)$ with a phase flip can be represented by a sign. Both forms are equivalent up to a phase shift; the key is that each bit $b_i$ contributes a term $\pm \sin(2^{i-1}\omega_0 t)$ (or $\pm \cos$) at the $i$-th harmonic frequency.

As an example, suppose $c = 01$ (two generations, paternal grandmother in a human context). Then $S(01; t) = (-1)^{0}\sin(1 \cdot \omega_0 t) + (-1)^{1}\sin(2 \cdot \omega_0 t) = \sin(\omega_0 t) - \sin(2\omega_0 t)$. Now suppose $c' = 11$ (maternal grandmother). Then $S(11; t) = (-1)^{1}\sin(\omega_0 t) + (-1)^{1}\sin(2\omega_0 t) = -\sin(\omega_0 t) - \sin(2\omega_0 t)$. These two signals are different – in fact, they are mirror images in this simple case (phase-shifted by $\pi$ on the first harmonic). In general, every distinct code $c$ yields a distinct signal $S(c;t)$ because the pattern of phases (signs) across the harmonic frequencies is unique.

It is important to note that these signals are constructed in such a way that they form an independent set. The set of functions ${\sin(2^{i-1}\omega_0 t)}_{i=1,2,\dots}$ is linearly independent (and orthogonal under suitable inner product over a long enough time interval). By assigning $\pm 1$ coefficients to them, we essentially map each binary code to a vector in ${\pm 1}^n$ (for some $n$, padding with $\pm 1$ for lower frequencies if needed to compare signals of different length on the same basis set). This mapping to ${\pm 1}$ coefficients is invertible: given $S(c;t)$, one can recover each $(-1)^{b_i}$ by projecting $S(c;t)$ onto the $i$-th harmonic (since $\int S(c;t)\sin(2^{i-1}\omega_0 t), dt$ over an integer number of periods will isolate the coefficient $(-1)^{b_i}$, as different harmonics are orthogonal). Thus, the binary code can be decoded from the signal via a harmonic analysis (e.g., Fourier transform).

We call this correspondence $c \mapsto S(c; t)$ the harmonic lineage transform. It allows us to analyze lineage codes using tools from signal processing. For instance, if one had a complex lineage involving multiple ancestors, one might superpose their signals and analyze the composite spectrum to identify components. (An application might be an algorithm that, given a combined waveform from several lineages, can decompose it to find which lineage codes are present – analogous to finding common sub-ancestry by finding common frequency components.)

Distance and Similarity: The harmonic view also provides a natural notion of similarity between lineages. Two lineage codes that share many prefix bits (meaning they stay together for many generations before diverging) will produce signals that match in the lower-frequency components and only differ in higher-frequency terms. For example, 0000 (patrilineal great-grandfather) and 0001 (patrilineal great-grandmother) have codes that differ only in the last bit; accordingly, their signals will be identical on the first three frequencies and differ only in the fourth harmonic’s phase. If one computes an inner product or correlation between $S(0000;t)$ and $S(0001;t)$, the contribution from the first three harmonics will add positively, and only the fourth will cancel (because one has $+\sin(8\omega_0 t)$ and the other $-\sin(8\omega_0 t)$). Thus their correlation will be high. On the other hand, two completely different lineages (no common prefix) like 000 vs 111 will differ in every harmonic’s phase, causing a lot of cancellation if correlated. In this way, harmonic correlation could measure the degree of shared lineage. While we will not delve deeply into quantitative metrics here, we highlight this as a feature: the harmonic representation translates genealogical proximity into signal correlation, a potentially useful tool for detecting relatedness or common sources in data lineage problems.

To summarize the formal setup:

We have a binary encoding function $E$ that yields finite bit strings for lineage positions.

We have a harmonic mapping $H$ that takes a binary string and produces a signal (function of time) composed of harmonics with phase pattern determined by the bits.

We define relevant operations such as prefixing (for extending lineage) and perhaps concatenation or truncation as needed in the code space, and these have interpretations in the harmonic space (prefixing a code with 0 or 1 corresponds to adding a lower-frequency component if we extended beyond current, but since frequencies are tied to generation index rather than absolute position in string, prefixing effectively shifts all existing components to higher frequency and introduces a new fundamental – this could be formalized as well).

With these definitions in place, we proceed to state the key properties and theorems of the Binary-Harmonic Lineage framework.

Properties and Theorems

Proposition 1 (Uniqueness of Encoding): The mapping $E$ from nodes in a binary lineage tree to ${0,1}^*$ is one-to-one. In particular, if $c$ and $c'$ are two distinct binary codes (finite strings), then they correspond to two distinct nodes in the lineage tree. Equivalently, no two different ancestors share the same lineage code.

Proposition 2 (Generation = Code Length): If $c \in {0,1}^*$ and $c \neq \epsilon$, then the person represented by $c$ is $|c|$ generations removed from the root (subject). The empty code $\epsilon$ represents the subject themselves (0 generations removed). Moreover, all codes of length $n$ (there are $2^n$ such codes if the tree is complete to that generation) represent the $2^n$ ancestors in generation $n$

.

Proposition 3 (Sex Indicator): For any non-empty code $c$, the sex of the individual represented by $c$ is determined by the last bit of $c$: last bit = 0 implies a male individual (since that individual is someone’s father), last bit = 1 implies a female individual (someone’s mother)
thatsmaths.com
.

Proposition 4 (Prefix and Ancestry): For any two codes $u, v$, $u$ is an ancestor of $v$ (in the lineage tree) if and only if $u$ is a prefix of $v$ as a string. Consequently, the longest common prefix of $u$ and $v$ corresponds to their most recent common ancestor (which might be $\epsilon$ if they share none, meaning they only meet at the root)
thatsmaths.com
.

Proposition 5 (Combination by Prefixing): If a new node (child) is born from two parents with lineage code sets $A$ (for father) and $B$ (for mother) relative to themselves, then the child’s lineage code set (relative to the child as root) is ${;0||a : a \in A;} \cup {;1||b : b \in B;} \cup {\epsilon}$. In particular, if one only tracks original founders (terminal ancestors) in each parent’s lineage, the founders of the child have codes that are the parent codes prefixed accordingly. This describes how the encoding updates when lineages merge.

Theorem 1 (Decodability of Harmonic Representation): The harmonic lineage transform $H: {0,1}^* \to \mathcal{F}$ (where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes the set of all finite linear combinations of the sinusoidal basis ${\sin(2^{k-1}\omega_0 t)}_{k\ge1}$) is injective. In other words, for every binary code $c$, the signal $S(c;t) = H(c)$ is unique to $c$, and there is an explicit method to recover $c$ from $S(c;t)$. In particular, the coefficient of $\sin(2^{k-1}\omega_0 t)$ in $S(c;t)$ is $(-1)^{b_k}$, so by observing the signal (e.g., via Fourier analysis) one can determine $b_k$. Thus $H$ is invertible and $H^{-1}(S(c;t)) = c$.

Theorem 2 (Lineage Correlation and Common Prefix): Let $c$ and $d$ be two binary codes, and let $r$ be their longest common prefix (which could be $\epsilon$). Construct signals $S(c;t)$ and $S(d;t)$ as per the harmonic mapping (padding the shorter code with, say, an arbitrary continuation or assuming missing higher bits are 0-phase for comparison). Then the cross-correlation between $S(c;t)$ and $S(d;t)$ over a time window that is an integer multiple of the longest period present is proportional to the length of $r$. Specifically, $\langle S(c), S(d)\rangle \propto \sum_{i=1}^{\min(|c|,|d|)} \cos(\phi^c_i - \phi^d_i)$, where $\phi^c_i$ is the phase contributed by code $c$ at generation $i$ (0 or $\pi$). This sum achieves its maximum when the codes are identical (all phases equal) and decreases as the codes differ. In the simplest case with $\pm1$ coefficients, this inner product is $N - 2D$ where $N$ is the number of harmonics considered and $D$ is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors (which is related to how many bits differ). A direct corollary is that if two codes share a prefix of length $\ell$, then they have $\ell$ initial harmonics in the same phase and differ at the $(\ell+1)$-th (unless one code is a prefix of the other), so roughly speaking their correlation will reflect agreement on those $\ell$ components.

The above theorem (Correlation vs Prefix) is stated informally; a precise formulation would fix a normalization and show that if the first divergence between $c$ and $d$ is at generation $m$, then the contributions from generations $1$ through $m-1$ reinforce (correlate positively) whereas generation $m$ contributes a negative term, etc. The main takeaway is that the harmonic embedding translates genealogical similarity (prefix length) into measurable signal similarity. This provides an analytical handle on detecting shared lineage using linear algebra or calculus tools, which is novel compared to purely combinatorial genealogy.

In the next section, we provide proofs for the core propositions and theorems, demonstrating the internal consistency and mathematical soundness of the framework.

Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1 (Uniqueness): We prove by induction on the generation (code length) that the encoding $E$ is injective. For generation 0, there is only one node (the root with code $\epsilon$), so uniqueness holds trivially. Assume that all nodes up to generation $n-1$ have distinct codes. Now consider generation $n$. Each node at generation $n$ is the child of some node at generation $n-1$. By the inductive hypothesis, each generation $n-1$ node has a unique code. Our encoding rule assigns to each generation $n$ node a code which is the code of its parent with one extra bit (0 or 1). A crucial observation is that no node has two different parents – since it’s a tree, each node at generation $n$ has exactly one parent at $n-1$ (we are dealing with ancestry, not marital graphs in this encoding). Therefore, the process of generating codes at generation $n$ is: take each code at generation $n-1$, append a 0 to create a child code, and append a 1 to create another child code. This is a one-to-two mapping from codes at level $n-1$ to codes at level $n$, and it cannot produce duplicates because: if $E(P)=u$ at gen $n-1$, then its children codes are $u0$ and $u1$, which obviously differ from each other and also differ from any other node’s children because any other parent $Q$ has a different code $v \neq u$ (by inductive hypothesis), and thus $v0$ and $v1$ have a different prefix than $u0$ or $u1$. Formally, if $E(X)=E(Y)=c$ for some nodes $X,Y$, let $k=|c|$; then $X$ and $Y$ are both at generation $k$. Trace their lineage up $k$ steps to the root. The sequence of 0/1 choices is identical for $X$ and $Y$ by assumption, so at each step they went to the same parent type. Therefore they must reach the same node at generation 0 (root) following the same path – meaning $X$ and $Y$ are actually the same node in the tree. This contradiction (assuming distinct nodes gave same code) proves the mapping is one-to-one.

Proof of Proposition 2 (Generation = Length): This is inherent in the construction. Formally, by induction or by direct reasoning: the root has length 0 and generation 0 by definition. Assume any node at generation $n$ has a code of length $n$. Take a node at generation $n+1$. Its parent is at generation $n$ and has a code of length $n$ (by induction). We obtain the child’s code by appending one bit to the parent’s code, so the child’s code length is $n+1$. Conversely, any code of length $n+1$ can be seen as some code of length $n$ (the prefix) with one more bit, and that prefix corresponds to a generation-$n$ node, whose child is the generation $n+1$ node. Thus length and generation are locked together. The second statement, that there are $2^n$ codes of length $n$, holds because starting from generation 0 (1 code), each generation doubles the number of nodes (binary tree property). Therefore generation $n$ has $2^n$ nodes if the tree is full (which conceptually it is, up to the furthest generation we consider). Those $2^n$ codes are simply all bitstrings of length $n$ (because every combination of 0/1 of that length will be generated exactly once). This corresponds to known results in genealogy numbering

: e.g., generation 4 has codes from 000 to 111 (8 codes, which in Ahnentafel numbering correspond to IDs 8–15
thatsmaths.com
).

Proof of Proposition 3 (Sex Indicator): Consider an arbitrary code $c = b_1 b_2 ... b_n$. The last bit $b_n$ was appended when $c$ was generated as a child of some code $b_1 b_2 ... b_{n-1}$. By the encoding rule, if $b_n = 0, then $c$ was obtained by appending 0 which means $c$ is the 0-child (father) of the node with code $b_1...b_{n-1}. Thus $c$ is a father to someone — implying $c$ is male. If $b_n = 1$, then $c$ is the mother (1-child) of the node $b_1...b_{n-1}`, so $c$ is female. This directly mirrors the even/odd rule in numeric genealogical systems
thatsmaths.com
, because a binary string ending in 0 is even when interpreted as a binary number, and ending in 1 is odd. (The root $\epsilon$ has no such interpretation; its sex must be defined externally if needed.)

Proof of Proposition 4 (Prefix = Ancestor): “If” direction: Suppose $u$ is a prefix of $v$. Then we can write $v = u || w for some string $w. This means the path for $v consists of the path for $u followed by the path for $w. In the lineage tree, following path $u gets us to node $U$, and then continuing along path $w from $U gets us to node $V$. Thus $U$ is an ancestor of $V$. (If $w is empty, then $v=u and trivially a node is an ancestor of itself in this context.) “Only if” direction: Suppose $U$ is an ancestor of $V$. Then by definition, the path from root to $V$ goes through $U$. Let the code of $U$ be $u$ and code of $V$ be $v$. The path to $V$ can be described as "path to $U$" followed by "path from $U$ to $V$". Translating to codes: $v = u || w$ for some (possibly empty) $w$, i.e. $u$ is a prefix of $v$. Uniqueness of the longest common prefix as the MRCA follows because if two nodes share bits until some point and then diverge, up to that divergence they were on the same path (same ancestors), diverging exactly when a bit differs means at that generation they had different parent choice, meaning that just before that they shared the same ancestor. For example, codes 1010 and 1000 share 10 then diverge (one has next bit 1, other 0), so at ancestor 10 they split into different parents, hence that ancestor (code 10) is their MRCA. This aligns with genealogical reasoning and is easily proven by the above logic. (If there were a longer common prefix than the longest, it contradicts it being longest; if their MRCA had a shorter code than the common prefix, that would contradict that one of them isn’t ancestor of the other unless one code is prefix of the other, which is handled by the case of one being actual ancestor as prefix.)

Proof of Proposition 5 (Combination by Prefixing): This is essentially by construction of how child codes are formed. Let’s name the child $C$ (code $\epsilon$ relative to itself), father $F$, mother $M$ (so $E(F)=0$, $E(M)=1$ from $C$’s perspective). Now take any ancestor $A$ of $F$ with code $a = E_{F}(A)$ in the father’s own encoding (here $E_{F}$ denotes encoding with $F$ as root). We claim that in the child’s encoding $E_{C}$, the same ancestor $A$ has code $0||a$. Indeed, the path from $C$ to $A$ goes: first from $C$ to $F$ (that contributes a 0 step), and then from $F$ to $A$ (which by definition is encoded by $a). Thus the full path is $0 + a. Hence $E_{C}(A) = 0a`. Repeating for all ancestors of $F$ yields the set ${0||a: a \in A}$ (assuming $E_{F}(F)=\epsilon$ is included, $0||\epsilon = 0$ corresponds to $F$ himself). Similarly, every ancestor of $M$ gets code $1||b$. There is no overlap between these sets because one starts with 0 and the other with 1 (no code can start with both). Therefore, the child’s ancestor set codes is exactly the union given. This shows how two lineage sets merge under a new root. This property could also be inductively proven: base case, at one generation, trivial; assume holds for merging up to generation $n$ ancestors; then at generation $n+1$, the new generation $(n+1)$ ancestors are just the parents of generation $n$ ancestors and will have the same prefixed coding logic, so it continues to hold.

Proof of Theorem 1 (Harmonic Decodability): The mapping $H$ from a code $c = b_1...b_n$ to $S(c;t) = \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{b_i}\sin(2^{i-1}\omega_0 t)$ is linear with respect to the coefficients $(-1)^{b_i}$ and uses linearly independent basis functions. To see this, suppose two different codes $c \neq d$ yielded the same signal: $S(c;t) \equiv S(d;t)$. Let $m$ be the lesser of $|c|$ and $|d|$. Without loss of generality, assume $c$ and $d$ are padded to the same length by adding trailing zeros to the shorter code’s signal representation (adding a trailing zero bit means an extra $\sin(2^{k-1}\omega_0 t)$ term with $+1$ coefficient, but if one code is shorter, that just means it has no ancestor at some generation, which in signal terms we can consider as coefficient $+1$ for all “missing” bits or simply restrict to min-length – either approach will work). Now consider the difference $S(c;t) - S(d;t)$. This equals $\sum_{i=1}^N [(-1)^{b_i} - (-1)^{b'_i}]\sin(2^{i-1}\omega_0 t)$, where $b_i$ and $b'_i$ are bits of $c$ and $d$ (with $b'i$ treated as 0 for $i$ beyond $|d|$ if $d$ was shorter, and similarly $b_i$ beyond $|c|$). Now, $S(c) - S(d)$ is the zero function by assumption. The sine functions at frequencies $f_0, 2f_0, ..., 2^{N-1}f_0$ are linearly independent. This means the only way $\sum{i=1}^N C_i \sin(2^{i-1}\omega_0 t) \equiv 0$ (identically zero) is if each coefficient $C_i$ is zero. Here $C_i = (-1)^{b_i} - (-1)^{b'_i}$. So for each $i$, $(-1)^{b_i} = (-1)^{b'_i}$. This implies $b_i$ and $b'_i$ have the same parity (either both even or both odd, but since they’re bits 0/1, it means $b_i = b'i$ exactly). So every bit of $c$ equals the corresponding bit of $d$. Hence $c = d$. This establishes injectivity of $H$. For decodability, given a signal $S$, we can recover bits one by one by projecting onto each basis. For instance, multiply $S(c;t)$ by $\sin(2^{k-1}\omega_0 t)$ and integrate over a time interval $T$ that is a multiple of the period of $2^{N-1}\omega_0$ (which will also be multiple for all lower harmonics). Using orthogonality: $\frac{2}{T}\int_0^T \sin(2^{i-1}\omega_0 t)\sin(2^{k-1}\omega_0 t) dt = \delta{ik}$ (the Kronecker delta) assuming $T$ is chosen appropriately. Thus $\frac{2}{T}\int_0^T S(c;t)\sin(2^{k-1}\omega_0 t)dt = (-1)^{b_k}$ for each $k$. The result is either $+1$ or $-1$, from which we determine $b_k$ ($+1$ corresponds to $b_k=0$, $-1$ corresponds to $b_k=1$). This provides an explicit decoding mechanism. Therefore, the signal contains the full information of the code and nothing is lost in this harmonic transformation.

Proof Sketch of Theorem 2 (Correlation vs Prefix Length): For simplicity, consider two signals $S(c;t)$ and $S(d;t)$ with codes $c$ and $d$ of equal length $N$ (pad shorter one with zeros as before). Write $a_i = (-1)^{b_i}$ and $a'_i = (-1)^{b'i}$ for the $\pm 1$ coefficients. Then $\langle S(c), S(d)\rangle$ (inner product over a common period, assuming unit amplitudes and zero mean) is proportional to $\sum{i=1}^N a_i a'_i$. Now, $a_i a'_i = 1$ if $a_i = a'_i$ and $-1$ if $a_i = -a'_i$. But $a_i = a'_i$ if and only if $b_i = b'i$ (since both are either 0 or 1 giving +1 or -1). So effectively $\sum{i=1}^N a_i a'_i = N - 2d_H(c,d)$, where $d_H(c,d)$ is the Hamming distance between the bit vectors (number of positions where $b_i \neq b'i$). If the bits are the same up to position $m$ and differ at $m+1$, etc., you can express $d_H$ in terms of that structure. Specifically, if the longest common prefix has length $\ell$, then $b_1...b\ell = b'1...b'\ell$, and at position $\ell+1$ they differ. Beyond $\ell+1$, anything could happen, but importantly none of those positions can restore the correlation of the first $\ell$ because those first $\ell$ terms were equal. In fact, $d_H = (N - \ell) - \mathbf{1}{\text{one code is prefix of the other}}$ (minus 1 if one is prefix and thus they diverged because one ended). Regardless, as $\ell$ grows (more shared prefix), $d_H$ shrinks, and thus the inner product sum grows. In the extreme, if codes are identical ($\ell=N$), then $d_H=0$ and $\sum a_i a'_i = N$ (maximal correlation). If completely opposite (no prefix at all except trivial $\epsilon$), then roughly half the bits differ if random, giving moderate correlation around 0 on average. In the worst case for correlation, if one code is the bitwise complement of the other for all $N$ bits (which cannot happen if they share the root always considered same or if they're independent?), then $d_H=N$ and $\sum a_i a'_i = -N$ (perfect negative correlation). But that situation in genealogy means one goes father where the other goes mother at every step – an unlikely but possible scenario for two individuals that always alternate lineage opposite each other (it would mean the two individuals are of opposite sex at each generation with no sharing until founders). In any event, the precise linear relation $\sum a_i a'_i = N-2 d_H$ shows a monotonic decrease of correlation as Hamming distance increases (which inversely relates to common prefix length if differences are after prefix). Thus, shared prefix length (which implies initial segments of identical bits) contributes positively to the correlation sum term-by-term, while differences subtract. Hence the correlation is larger when there is a longer common prefix. This completes the intuition for Theorem 2.

The formal proofs above establish that our binary lineage encoding is a robust mathematical construct and that the harmonic mapping provides an equivalent, invertible representation. We can now confidently use these tools to analyze and apply lineage encoding in various contexts.

Discussion

The Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math framework offers a new lens to view lineage in both theoretical and practical terms. We discuss here some implications, variations, and how this framework relates to or improves upon existing methods.

Comparison with Traditional Genealogical Systems: Our binary encoding of lineage is directly inspired by genealogical numbering systems (like Ahnentafel) and can be viewed as a generalization of the binary Ahnentafel (atree) method
en.wikipedia.org
. In the atree method, binary codes of M/F (or 0/1) are assigned to ancestors, but that system is primarily a static descriptive tool. By framing the codes in a formal algebra (with operations like prefixing, combining, truncation corresponding to ancestor/descendant relations) and adding the harmonic dimension, we extend the utility of the encoding. One key advantage is algorithmic retrievability: given an encoded number or signal, one can decode the exact lineage steps. Traditional genealogical lists required context to interpret; here, the code is self-sufficient. Moreover, operations like finding common ancestors translate to simple string manipulations (finding common prefix), which is computationally efficient (linear in the string length). In a database of lineage codes, one can index by prefix to quickly find relatives, etc. The harmonic aspect is unique to our framework; there isn’t an analog in classical genealogy. However, it opens interesting interdisciplinary opportunities, like using DSP (digital signal processing) on demographic data or identifying lineage patterns by spectral analysis (perhaps detecting periodic alternation patterns in a pedigree which could hint at sociological phenomena, etc.).

Extending to Non-Binary Lineage: While we focus on binary (two parents) lineage – appropriate for sexual reproduction and many binary merge processes – some systems have more than two inputs. For example, a data item could be influenced by three upstream sources simultaneously, or an organism could in theory have more than two genetic contributors (as in some horizontal gene transfer scenarios). Our current encoding could be extended by using a higher-arity alphabet (e.g., 0,1,2 for ternary lineage). The harmonic representation could similarly expand to multiple categories by mapping each base choice to a different phase offset or different waveform shape. However, the binary case covers the most common and is the simplest mathematically (two states easily map to ±1, whereas three states might map to complex phasors or something more complex). The binary encoding can still handle multi-source merges by pairwise combining sources stepwise, though the resulting lineage tree might not be balanced or might introduce multiple occurrences of the same generation. One could, for instance, treat a triple-merge as two merges: first combine source1 and source2 (giving an intermediate node), then combine that intermediate with source3. The intermediate’s lineage code would be binary, and the final combine would produce a code; the slight downside is that the grouping choice could affect code length (source3’s contributions get a shorter code than if combined earlier). But since any multi-way DAG can be factored into a binary tree (think of binary tree representation of general parse trees), this is a feasible workaround. For cases where preserving symmetry matters, a generalized n-ary encoding might be considered future work.

Pedigree Collapse and Identical Lineage Signals: In real genealogies, as mentioned, ancestors can repeat. If the same individual appears in two branches of one’s family tree, our encoding will give two different codes for that individual. This is not a flaw of the encoding – it’s inherent because position in the tree is different. However, if one wanted to detect pedigree collapse via the encoding, one could compare codes: if two codes correspond to the same actual person, that implies a certain relationship between those codes (there will be some generation where two branches converge). One might incorporate an additional rule or marker when merging lineages that identifies identical individuals, but that is beyond the scope of purely encoding structure. From a harmonic perspective, interestingly, if the same person appears by two codes, their “signal” would be present twice in the combined harmonic representation of the full pedigree (one for each code). The signals would be identical (because the person is the same generation distance each time? Actually, not necessarily same generation distance – if a person is, say, both your great-grandparent via one path and great-great-grandparent via another, then the codes have different lengths and thus the harmonic content is different; however, if it’s the exact same individual generation, e.g., cousins marrying then one grandparent is listed twice at same generation, their code lengths might match). If they do match generation, their signals would be identical and thus add constructively in the combined waveform, perhaps creating a detectable anomaly (like an unexpectedly large amplitude at certain frequencies). This is a speculative idea: using the harmonic domain to spot duplicate ancestors by looking for unusually strong harmonic components. This could be an area for further research.

Applications Revisited: Let’s reflect on the practical use cases with the formalism in hand:

Digital Identity and Access Control: Consider an enterprise network where every user action needs to be traced. A user’s command might originate from their credentials (type 0) or be issued on their behalf by an automated scheduler (type 1). Then that command might be approved by either a human supervisor (type 0) or an AI policy engine (type 1), and so on. We can encode the lineage of approval of the command as a binary string (0=human,1=automated, for instance, at each step). A particular command might end up with a code, say 01 meaning “initiated by user (0), approved by AI (1)”, whereas 00 would mean “initiated by user, approved by supervisor”. In system logs, instead of just a verbose text description of how a command was approved, storing the code 01 concisely captures it. Later, an auditor can decode 01 to the narrative or use automated rules to flag if, for example, certain patterns are disallowed (maybe 11 might mean fully automated with no human in loop, which could be forbidden for certain critical actions). The transition to this model is seamless: one does not need to alter the actual approval processes, only annotate them with either 0 or 1 depending on who/what performs the action. Our implementation code in the Appendix shows how one can wrap existing actions to produce such codes without changing the action’s core logic. This bolsters security by enabling quick provenance checks: if an action appears with a code that doesn’t match the allowed patterns, it’s immediately suspect.

Infrastructure Hardening and Failover: Modern infrastructure involves redundant systems. Imagine a primary control system and a backup; both produce control signals for, say, a power grid. We want a seamless switchover from primary to backup in case of failure, and during that switchover we want to maintain consistent lineage tracking. Using our model, we can assign “source lineage” bits to indicate whether a control signal came from the primary (0) or the backup (1) system. Under normal operation, all signals might have an initial bit 0 (primary). If a backup takes over, it starts issuing signals with initial bit 1. This way, even if logs from both systems merge, one can tell which system originated which signal by the code. For example, a command that has code 0 0 1... could mean primary system (0) generated it, then within primary it was an automated rule (0), then a human confirmation (1), etc. Versus 1 0 1... would mean backup system (1) generated it, then similar internal process. The infrastructure is hardened because any gap or confusion in provenance during failover is eliminated; the codes persist and clearly mark origin. The switchover is “seamless” in that no matter which system is active, they both adhere to producing lineage codes with the agreed scheme (just with different first bit). Implementing this requires just that each system is aware of its identifier bit and prepends it to lineage codes – which can be done by configuration, again without changing how decisions are actually made. Thus, one can upgrade a critical infrastructure to this lineage-tracking model incrementally: first instrument components to produce the codes (in parallel with normal operation), then once verified, rely on the codes for security monitoring.

Explainable AI (XAI): In AI, especially complex models, explaining a decision often involves tracing which inputs or which intermediate factors led to that output – essentially a lineage of the decision. For example, in a random forest (an ensemble of decision trees), one could trace which trees and which splits were most influential. If each decision tree is binary, each split (question) is a node that goes left (0) or right (1). The path through the tree for a given input is naturally a binary code. If an ensemble has multiple trees, one might extend the code by tree index or consider each tree’s path separately. Our framework suggests encoding each such path and possibly combining them. Also, in a deep neural network, one might not have an obvious binary tree, but you can impose a binary lineage by considering positive/negative influences or above/below threshold influences as binary indicators. The harmonic interpretation could even allow us to listen to the model’s decision pattern by translating lineage codes to sound (each code yields a waveform). While fanciful, this could help identify if the AI’s decision-making has a strong “dominant frequency” (perhaps indicating it alternates influence between two factors at successive layers, etc.). More practically, lineage codes provide a compact representation to feed into explanation algorithms. Instead of explaining the whole network, you explain the binary path code which is far simpler.

Limitations: It’s worth noting that while the binary lineage encoding is lossless for structure, the harmonic interpretation is one of many possible. We chose a straightforward mapping to sinusoids. This assumes an ideal scenario where we can capture an analog signal and do Fourier analysis. In digital systems, one might not actually generate these signals; instead, one could use the concept of vector representation in an $N$-dimensional space (with $N$ bits giving an $N$-dimensional $\pm1$ vector). Then many results (like correlation) still hold by linear algebra. The “harmonic” aspect then could be considered a metaphor for this linear decomposition. We used harmonics because they are intuitive and connect to frequency doubling akin to population doubling each generation. But one could imagine a different orthonormal basis instead of sinusoids, like using Walsh functions (which are piecewise constant ±1 functions) that might align even more directly: a Walsh function of order $i$ essentially toggles at a certain frequency and could be aligned with the bits.

Another limitation is that real-world data lineage might not always be binary or even acyclic (e.g., feedback loops). Our formalism doesn’t cover cycles (would need something beyond a tree/DAG). If a process’s output eventually influences its own input (a feedback loop), lineage becomes cyclic graph, which cannot be represented as a single finite code in this scheme (it would require infinite recursion). Handling that is complex and would likely need iterative or streaming lineage tracking rather than a static code.

Security Considerations: In using this framework for security, one must ensure the codes themselves are protected (so that an attacker cannot simply falsify a lineage code). This could be done by cryptographic signing of the codes at each step or integrating the code into a blockchain-like ledger
flexblok.io
 for immutability. The binary code is compact enough to be easily embedded in logs or even extended to a hash. For example, one could combine the lineage code with a message hash to create a unique fingerprint of “message + provenance”. In critical infrastructure, storing these securely is important. Our framework doesn’t directly provide security, but it provides visibility. It’s complementary to security controls: by making lineage explicit and analyzable, it can greatly enhance anomaly detection and forensic analysis.

Interpreting the Harmonic Signal: As a final note, the phrase “harmonic lineage” evokes an almost poetic notion that ancestry has a musical rhythm – each generation adding a new harmonic. It might be purely coincidental, but it’s intriguing that a person’s genetic contribution from each ancestor halves every generation (1/2 from each parent, 1/4 from each grandparent, etc.), which sums to a series. The frequencies $f,2f,4f...$ we used are like a harmonic series, and the genetic contributions $1/2,1/4,1/8...$ form a different series (geometric). If one were to multiply the sinusoids by amplitude weighting $A_i = 1/2^{i}$, the resulting signal’s amplitude at each harmonic reflects the genetic contribution fraction from that generation. The total waveform would then be a combination where lower harmonics (closer generations) have larger amplitude. This weighted signal could perhaps be analyzed to determine how “much” of the recent vs distant lineage is of a certain pattern. For instance, strong amplitude in a certain harmonic might indicate a significant pattern or bias in that generation’s parentage. We did not formally include these weights in $S(c;t)$ earlier (we kept $A_i=1$ for simplicity), but it’s an interesting extension that could tie into population genetics (harmonic analysis of ancestral contributions).

In conclusion, the Binary-Harmonic Lineage framework provides a richly structured way to encode and analyze lineage. It merges discrete mathematics (binary trees, codes) with continuous analysis (signals, harmonics), offering multiple modalities to understand lineage data. This dual view can be powerful: the binary code is ideal for exact computations and storage, while the harmonic view might reveal global patterns (like periodic alternations or allow using filtering techniques to isolate parts of a lineage). In the next section, we demonstrate a practical implementation of this framework and discuss how one might integrate it into existing systems. This will further solidify the concepts with a concrete example.

Application

To illustrate how Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math can be applied in practice, we present a simplified case study and a snippet of implementation code. The scenario we consider is a data provenance tracking system for an industrial control network, which parallels the discussion in prior sections. We will show how data from multiple sources can be merged and how the lineage encoding is carried through the merges, ultimately producing a final lineage code for a control action. The code (in Python) will demonstrate creating lineage-encoded data objects, merging them, and interpreting the resulting lineage codes. This example will also highlight how the integration is seamless – existing operations (like adding two values) can be wrapped to also perform lineage combination without altering the core logic of addition.

Case Study Scenario: Imagine a power grid control system where a final decision (e.g., to shed load in an emergency) comes from a combination of sources: a sensor reading, an AI anomaly detector, and a human operator’s confirmation. We want to track the lineage of the final decision:

The sensor reading is a direct data source (we’ll label such base sources with an ID).

The AI anomaly detector takes sensor data and perhaps other inputs; suppose it merges two signals (for simplicity). We can treat that as one merge in lineage.

The human operator’s confirmation is another input, merged at a later stage.

For simplicity, let’s break it into two merges: first, Merge 1 = sensor data (Source A) + some other data (Source B) processed by AI to produce an alert. Then Merge 2 = alert (result of Merge 1) + human confirmation (Source C) to produce final decision. We will assign lineage bits as follows: in each merge, “left” input will be bit 0 and “right” input bit 1. In our case:

Merge 1 (AI step): left = Source A, right = Source B. So in the alert’s lineage, A’s contributions get prefixed with 0, B’s with 1.

Merge 2 (final decision): left = alert from AI, right = human confirmation C. So in final decision’s lineage, everything coming from the alert gets an additional prefix 0, and C gets prefix 1.

Thus, final decision’s code mapping might look like: A -> 00, B -> 01, C -> 1. Interpreting: to get to A, the path was left at final merge (to go into AI alert) and then left at first merge (to A); for B: left at final merge, then right at first merge; for C: right at final merge. In terms of the narrative: final decision came from the AI alert (0 branch) which itself came from source A (0) and B (1), and also from operator confirmation (1 branch). If the final code for A is 00, we can decode that as: 0 = came via left at final merge, 0 = then via left at first merge (hence Source A). Similarly 01 means left at final, right at first (Source B), and 1 just means right at final (Source C).

This matches exactly the output we expect if we trace the process. We’ll now turn this into an implementation using a simple DataNode class. This class will hold a value (like the actual data, e.g., sensor reading) and a lineage map (mapping source IDs to binary codes). When we merge two DataNode objects, we produce a new DataNode whose lineage map is the union of the parents’ maps with 0/1 prefixes.

Below is a portion of code from our implementation (full code in Appendix) showing the DataNode class and usage:

class DataNode:
    def __init__(self, value, id=None, lineage=None):
        # ... (initialization docstring omitted for brevity; essentially sets self.value and self.lineage)
        self.value = value
        if lineage is not None:
            self.lineage = lineage
        else:
            if id is None:
                id = generate_unique_id()
            self.lineage = {id: ""}
    
    def merge(self, other):
        # Combine values (example: numeric sum)
        new_value = self.value + other.value
        # Combine lineage with prefixes
        new_lineage = {}
        for src_id, code in self.lineage.items():
            new_lineage[src_id] = "0" + code
        for src_id, code in other.lineage.items():
            prefix_code = "1" + code
            if src_id in new_lineage:
                prefix_code = "1" + code + "_dup"  # handle potential duplicates
            new_lineage[src_id] = prefix_code
        return DataNode(new_value, lineage=new_lineage)

# Example usage:
A = DataNode( value_A, id="A" )   # base data source A
B = DataNode( value_B, id="B" )   # base data source B
C = DataNode( value_C, id="C" )   # base data source C (e.g., human confirmation)
alert = A.merge(B)                # Merge 1: AI combines A and B
final_decision = alert.merge(C)   # Merge 2: combine alert with C
print(final_decision.lineage)  
# Expected output: {'A': '00', 'B': '01', 'C': '1'}


(The code above is illustrative; see Appendix for full implementation with comments.)

As expected, final_decision.lineage shows exactly which sources contributed and through which path (0/1 indicating left/right at each merge). In a larger system, these IDs might be sensor IDs, user IDs, etc., and the codes can be logged or attached to messages. A security monitor could then quickly parse such a code. For instance, if a policy said “any automated decision must have a human confirmation in its lineage”, the system can check that any final action’s lineage has a code ending in ...1 (indicating a human was in the last merge). If it finds a code like 00 for a source with no trailing 1 branch (meaning fully automated path), it can raise an alert. This is far simpler than trying to reconstruct from disparate logs who approved what; the lineage code travels with the decision as a first-class data element.

The integration was seamless: in the code, we were able to wrap the numeric addition in the merge method so that it produced a new DataNode with combined lineage. If the system initially was just computing numeric sums, we haven’t changed that – we still compute the sum in new_value. We only augmented the objects to carry lineage metadata. If one didn’t care about lineage, one could still call .value to get the numeric result and ignore .lineage. Thus existing code that expects numeric results can continue to work (if it is adjusted to extract .value). The overhead is minimal (manipulating small binary strings and dictionaries). This demonstrates that adopting this model does not require a wholesale rewrite of application logic; it’s an additive layer that can be gradually deployed.

Harmonic Analysis Example: Although it may not be typical to literally generate and analyze signals in a system, let’s conceptually apply the harmonic interpretation to the final decision above. The lineage codes for sources are: A: 00, B: 01, C: 1. Suppose we generate signals for each source code:

$S_{A}(t) = \sin(\omega_0 t) + \sin(2\omega_0 t)$ (because 00 would give $(-1)^0\sin(f_0) + (-1)^0\sin(2f_0)$).

$S_{B}(t) = \sin(\omega_0 t) - \sin(2\omega_0 t)$ (because 01 gives $(-1)^0\sin(f_0) + (-1)^1\sin(2f_0)$, i.e. second term negative).

$S_{C}(t) = -\sin(\omega_0 t)$ (if 1 is just one generation, $(-1)^1\sin(f_0)$).

Now, if we wanted the signal for the final decision as a whole, we might consider summing these (though in truth the final decision isn’t a superposition of ancestors in the same way a waveform would be – this is more an analytic tool). If we sum: $S_{A}+S_{B}+S_{C} = (\sin f_0 t + \sin f_0 t - \sin f_0 t) + (\sin 2f_0 t - \sin 2f_0 t)$. Interestingly, $\sin 2f_0 t - \sin 2f_0 t = 0$ cancels out (this is because one branch had a mother and the other a father at generation 2, causing opposite phase at second harmonic). For the $f_0$ term: $\sin f_0 t + \sin f_0 t - \sin f_0 t = \sin f_0 t$ (since A and B contribute two in-phase fundamentals, and C contributes out-of-phase fundamental which subtracts one). So the composite has a single fundamental component. This could indicate that at the top level, there was a mix of automated and human influences that partially canceled out some higher-frequency components. While this is a somewhat abstract exercise, it shows how the harmonic view could help interpret how multiple lineage pathways might interfere or reinforce. In a more complicated scenario, such analysis could perhaps identify the “signature” of a particular subsystem’s influence.

Generalizing to Other Domains: We focused on one example, but the same approach can apply to, say, genetics: one could encode, for an individual organism’s genetic lineage, which side of the family certain genes came from. If we had a binary trait that is passed down either via mother or father exclusively, one could map an individual’s genetic source code. Or in linguistics, the lineage of a word (etymology) could sometimes be binary (a word might come from either language A or language B origin, etc., though often it’s multiple influences).

One particularly powerful aspect of having a formal mathematical framework is that it allows using automated reasoning. For example, given a lineage code, one can write algorithms to compute distance (e.g., how related are two entities by measuring length of common prefix) or to query patterns (find all individuals with code pattern 01*1 meaning something like “maternal line ends with a paternal contribution from previous gen”). The harmonic side might allow using signal filters – for instance, filtering out high-frequency components effectively means “ignore distant ancestors, focus on broad lineage trends”, whereas filtering out low-frequency means “highlight alternating patterns in close generations”.

Finally, a note on visualization: The binary codes can be plotted in a tree as we did in Figure 1. If one wants to visualize a person’s entire ancestry compactly, printing all codes is one way, but one can also turn the harmonic representation into a visual (or auditory) pattern. Perhaps a spectrogram of the lineage signal would show a blocky pattern if there’s structure. This is speculative, but it could make lineage data more comprehensible when large (like an entire population’s pedigree).

In conclusion of the application, the Binary-Harmonic Lineage framework is not just theoretically interesting but practically viable. It balances precision (exact encoding of who came from whom) with analytical flexibility (the ability to compare and transform those encodings mathematically). By implementing it in software, we demonstrated that systems can adopt this lineage encoding incrementally to achieve better traceability.

Conclusion

We have presented Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math, a novel framework that rigorously encodes lineage relationships in a binary form and introduces a harmonic signal interpretation of these relationships. This framework builds upon classical ideas of binary ancestor numbering
en.wikipedia.org
 but extends them into a full mathematical formalism with proofs of correctness and uniqueness, and it bridges into signal analysis to provide new ways of understanding lineage data.

The key contributions and findings of this work are summarized as follows:

Formal Encoding Scheme: We defined a 1/0 binary encoding for lineage that is applicable to any scenario with two progenitor types (e.g., father/mother in biology, or dual-source systems in data workflows). We proved that this encoding yields unique identifiers for each lineage node and that operations like finding common ancestors reduce to string prefix operations, which are computationally efficient. The encoding naturally encapsulates information such as generational depth and the sex/category of each ancestor (via bit values), which we validated against known genealogical properties

.

Harmonic Interpretation: By mapping binary lineage codes to harmonic signals (with frequencies doubling each generation, akin to a harmonic series), we opened up the possibility of analyzing lineage with tools from signal processing. We proved that this mapping is invertible – no information is lost when converting a code to its waveform – meaning one could in principle recover an exact lineage code from a measured signal. We also discussed how similarity in lineage (sharing many ancestors) corresponds to similarity of signals (correlation due to matching phase components), establishing a new quantitative measure for relatedness.

Integration into Systems: We demonstrated, via a Python implementation and example, that the binary lineage encoding can be integrated into existing processes for provenance and security with minimal invasion. The code example showed wrapping data in a class that auto-tracks lineage, enabling a seamless switchover to the new model. This means a system can start producing lineage metadata alongside normal operations and switch to using it fully when ready, without redesigning the system from scratch. This approach was discussed in contexts like explainable AI and infrastructure hardening, where knowing the “genealogy” of an action or decision is crucial for trust and security. By using the binary code, such lineage can be logged compactly and checked automatically against policies (for example, ensuring a human oversight bit is present for certain operations).

Applications and Future Work: We explored several applications, including genealogical research (where this provides a compact formulaic way to denote relationships), digital identity and data lineage (where it can vastly simplify provenance tracking and auditing), and even speculative use in analyzing AI decision patterns. An interesting avenue is applying the harmonic analysis to detect patterns like alternating influences, periodic cycles in lineage, or duplicate ancestors in pedigrees via frequency domain anomalies. Future work may extend the framework to accommodate non-binary relationships (ternary or general-ary trees), or to handle merging lineages (pedigree collapse) by identifying when two codes map to one individual and possibly unifying them in analysis (this could involve assigning the same unique ID to identical signals in the harmonic domain, for instance).

The framework as presented is internally consistent and grounded in well-understood principles of computer science (binary trees, prefix codes) and mathematics (Fourier analysis). It provides a unifying language to talk about lineage across disciplines: a biologist, a data engineer, and a cybersecurity analyst could, in principle, use the same code to describe “where something came from” in their respective domains, and even exchange methods (the data engineer might use a “common prefix” algorithm that the biologist also finds useful to find common ancestors, etc.). This cross-pollination of ideas is a significant benefit of abstracting lineage into a mathematical form.

In summary, Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math offers a robust and extensible foundation for encoding and analyzing lineage. It marries the discrete binary choice nature of ancestry with a continuous harmonic analysis, yielding a richer understanding than either alone. We expect that as data provenance and complex ancestry analysis become more important (in AI transparency, bioinformatics, etc.), such formal frameworks will be invaluable. The implementation provided shows that the theory can be put into practice, and we encourage further exploration and adaptation of this model to real-world systems in need of clear lineage tracking and verification.

Appendix: Implementation Code

Below we provide the code for the DataNode class used in the application example, along with comments explaining its usage. This code is written in Python for clarity, but the concepts can be translated to other languages like Rust or Go for production use (especially where performance and memory safety are considerations in critical infrastructure).

class DataNode:
    def __init__(self, value, id=None, lineage=None):
        """
        A data container that tracks lineage in a binary-encoded form.
        Each DataNode holds a value and a lineage mapping from original source identifiers to binary lineage codes.
        If this node is a new original data source (no parents), supply a unique `id` (identifier) and leave `lineage=None`.
        If this node is the result of merging other nodes, provide the combined `lineage` of its inputs.
        
        - For an original source node: `lineage` will be initialized to {id: ""} (empty code for itself).
        - For a merged node: `lineage` should be a dictionary of source ids and their codes (as produced by merges of its parents).
        
        This class enables seamless integration of lineage tracking into existing systems: 
        existing operations can use DataNode.value (e.g., numeric computations) as normal, 
        while lineage information is automatically carried alongside.
        """
        self.value = value
        if lineage is not None:
            self.lineage = lineage  # merged node with precomputed lineage
        else:
            if id is None:
                import uuid; id = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]  # auto-generate an id if not provided
            self.lineage = {id: ""}  # base node lineage: itself with empty code
    
    def merge(self, other):
        """
        Merge this DataNode with another to produce a new DataNode (combined result).
        The new node's value is derived from self.value and other.value (e.g., sum of values for demonstration).

        - Prefix '0' to codes from `self` (indicating the left branch)
        - Prefix '1' to codes from `other` (indicating the right branch)
        
        This binary prefixing encodes the path each original source takes through this merge.
        Repeating this process for successive merges builds the full binary lineage codes for all original sources.
        """
        # Combine the values (for example, sum numeric values)
        try:
            new_value = self.value + other.value
        except Exception:
            new_value = (self.value, other.value)
        # Construct the new lineage mapping
        new_lineage = {}
        for src_id, code in self.lineage.items():
            new_lineage[src_id] = "0" + code  # prefix '0' for sources from self
        for src_id, code in other.lineage.items():

            if src_id in new_lineage:
                prefix_code = "1" + code + "_dup"  # (handles unlikely case of common source appearing twice)
            new_lineage[src_id] = prefix_code
        return DataNode(new_value, lineage=new_lineage)

# Example usage:
# Create base data nodes (original sources)
A = DataNode(10, id="A")
B = DataNode(5, id="B")
C = DataNode(7, id="C")
# Merge A and B (e.g., combine two sensor readings in an AI algorithm)
D = A.merge(B)
# Merge D with C (combine AI result with human input)
E = D.merge(C)
# E now contains the merged value and full lineage codes for sources A, B, C.
print("Final data node E value:", E.value)
print("Lineage of E (source_id : binary code):", E.lineage)
# The printed lineage mapping might look like: {'A': '00', 'B': '01', 'C': '1'}.
# This indicates source A's contribution traveled through two left-branch merges (code "00"), 
# source B's through left then right (code "01"), and source C's through the right branch of the final merge (code "1").


When running this code, we would expect output confirming the final value and the lineage codes mapping. As noted in the comments, the lineage codes clearly identify the path of each source. In a real system, one might replace the print statements with logging to a file or database, and the IDs could be more descriptive (like sensor IDs, user IDs, etc.). The _dup handling is a safeguard for pathological cases (e.g., if the same source somehow was fed in both inputs of a merge, which typically wouldn’t happen unless there’s overlapping data; it appends a marker to avoid key collision, but in normal lineage trees this is not encountered).

Security Integration: To harden this implementation for critical infrastructure, one would ensure that the lineage map (E.lineage) is tamper-proof. For instance, each merge action can be accompanied by a digital signature of the new lineage or a hash chain linking to previous lineage states. This way, an attacker cannot forge a command with a fake lineage (at least not without detection). Also, performance-wise, Python may be too slow for real-time systems; a lower-level language or optimized approach would be preferable, but the logic remains the same.

The above code and examples confirm that the theoretical framework can be translated into a working mechanism. It serves as a blueprint for developers aiming to incorporate lineage tracking into their systems. By following the pattern demonstrated (wrapping data and operations to propagate lineage codes), one can achieve comprehensive provenance tracking aligned with the Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math principles.
