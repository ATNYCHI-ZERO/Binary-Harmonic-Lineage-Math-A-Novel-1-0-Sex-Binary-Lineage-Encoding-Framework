Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math License (BHL License)

Summary of Rights and Responsibilities:

Permissive Use: This license allows use, modification, and distribution of the Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math framework for any purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial
fossa.com
. There are no field-of-use restrictions – it can be integrated into any project or environment (including critical infrastructure or proprietary/defense systems) without additional permission
en.wikipedia.org
.

Attribution Required: You must provide proper credit to the original creator of the BHL Math framework in any distribution or derivative. This includes preserving the copyright notice and license text in source code distributions
fossa.com
, and acknowledging the original Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math model (and its creator) in documentation or user interfaces (e.g. an "About" section).

Derivative Works: Any modified or derivative works must retain the core attribution to the original model and author. In practice, this means derivative projects should explicitly mention that they are derived from or include the BHL Math framework, ensuring the origin is clear
en.wikipedia.org
. (You are not required to open-source your own derivative works under this license, but you are required to carry forward the attribution clause.)

No Endorsement: You may not use the name of the original author nor the name "Binary-Harmonic Lineage Math" to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission
en.wikipedia.org
. The license grants no rights to use the author's identity or project name for marketing purposes, except to acknowledge the software’s origin as required above.

Contributions Encouraged: While not mandatory, you are encouraged to share improvements or fixes you make to the framework with the original author or community. This goodwill clause is not an open-source requirement (i.e. it does not force you to distribute your changes), but it invites collaboration to benefit everyone. (Permissive licenses do not require sharing modifications
fossa.com
, so this clause simply encourages voluntary contribution.)

No Warranty & Liability: The software is provided “as is” without any warranty, and the license disclaims all liability. The original creator (and any contributors) will not be held liable for any damages or issues arising from use of the BHL Math framework
en.wikipedia.org
. This mirrors the standard warranty disclaimer found in licenses like MIT/Apache and ensures that users assume all risks.
